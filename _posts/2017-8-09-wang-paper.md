Lifting the Haze off the Cloud: A Consumer-Centric Market for Database Computation in the Cloud by Wang et al., VLDB 2017. 

1) Biggest contribution: Studies the problem of cost optimization in the cloud. Specifically, the paper offers an agent-based framework that computes a pricing contract for performing a given task in the cloud under a given deadline. The agent has knowledge of multiple cloud providers so it returns multiple contracts, allowing the customer to choose the one with the lowest price. In my experience, the topic of cost optimization in the cloud is something that confuses many customers, so I think it is a valid problem to study. For example, knowing what RIs to purchase to save money on AWS and when to purchase them can be daunting at-scale. It often requires several stakeholders in the company and some additional tooling to make good decisions. 

2) Biggest mistake: One of the main advantages of moving to the cloud is to take advantage of elastic resources. This is important because most apps are dynamic by nature, making it very difficult in practice to predict traffic patterns and resource utilization. Unfortunately, this paper proposes a pricing framework that assumes the workload is known ahead of time. It evaluates the framework using TPC-H run on Postgres RDS and MapReduce WordCount, Sort and Join run on EMR. Not only are these benchmarks overly simplistic, but they are run only on 5GB of data. I think that these tests are inadequate because they don't capture the uncertainty of the workload, the greater volume of data, and the range of data services that are consumed in the cloud. 

3) Biggest question: If we assume that customers are open to switching cloud providers to take advantage of lower pricing (all other things being equal), then the question becomes at what point does it make sense to migrate from the current higher-priced platform to a lower-priced platform. This is not a simple question since migration efforts are often complex and expensive. It seems like a framework that recommends a certain cloud provider for running a given workload because it has better pricing should also account for the cost of migrating the workload.
