title: Introducing this blog
---

So, I've decided to start blogging about data management solutions in the cloud. 

Gives me a good excuse to get back into writing more regularly and also lets me write about an area that I've been deeply involved with. I've been a database practitioner for almost 2 decades. For the last few years, I have had the opportunity to architect numerous data management solutions for customers moving or expanding to the cloud. I work at Rackspace where I'm a Database Architect and also <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/index.html">teach</a> databases at UT Austin as an Adjunct Professor. You can read more about my background <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirleycohen/">here</a>. 

This blog is going to cover such diverse topics as big data, auto-scaling, and schema evolution all in the context of data management solutions in the cloud. However, it's not going to be a teaching blog. Rather, each post is going to be critique of a recent paper, blog post or technical presentation. I like reading academic papers and thinking about whether the published ideas can be applied to the use cases that I come across in my work as an architect. In fact, one of my goals with this blog is to point out where I think the research community hits the mark in terms of addressing real-world problems as well as where I see a disconnect between the research produced by the community and the practical issues faced by my customers.
