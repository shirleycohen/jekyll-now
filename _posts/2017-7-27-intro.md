title: Introducing this blog
---

I've decided to start a blog to share my thoughts on cloud data services. 

<!--more-->

I'm going to be reviewing recent papers, presentations, and blog posts on this topic and also critiquing them. My reviews will be based on my experience as a Solution Architect as well as my previous life as a Database Administrator. Each critique will follow a standard format that I used a long time ago as a grad student: **1) biggest contribution;** **2) biggest mistake;** **3) biggest question**. 

Please note: this is my personal blog and does not reflect the views of Rackspace or its management in any way.
