title: Introducing this blog
---

I've decided to start this blog to share my thoughts on modern data systems.

In the past decade, we've seen an explosion of data systems, many of them open-source. Some are even native to the cloud and referred to as "managed services" because they provide extra management, reliability, and scalability features. Notable examples include Amazon's Aurora, Google's Dataflow, and Microsoft's DocumentDB. I'm going to explore these and other data systems that are native to the cloud by reviewing some recent research papers on this subject area. 

My reviews will be shaped by my personal experiences as a Solution Architect and Database Administrator. Each review will follow a standard format that I used as a grad student some time ago: **1) [paper's] biggest contribution;** **2) [paper's] biggest mistake;** **3) [paper's] biggest question**. This format may seem a bit rigid, but I think its helps keep the posts down to a few paragraphs and also forces me to write concisely. 

My hope is that some of the reviews will be useful to those who are looking to go beyond the official how-to documentation for the products in question. More specifically, I'm going to examine the underlying systems that host these services and discuss some of the design choices and trade-offs that were made.
