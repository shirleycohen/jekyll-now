title: Introducing this blog
---

Well, I've decided to start my own blog on data management in the cloud. 

Gives me a good excuse to write more and also lets me write about an area that I've been deeply involved in recently. 

For those who don't know me, I'm a database practitioner. I've been working with databases for about 2 decades, starting as a database engineer evolving to database administration and more recently database architecture. I work at Rackspace where I get to architect database solutions for customers who are moving to the cloud. I also get to <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/index.html">teach</a> a semester-long database class at UT Austin in the Fall and Spring semesters. 

I want this blog to cover a wide variety of practical data management topics, e.g. stream processing, auto-scaling, and schema evolution, all in the context of the cloud. But I don't want this to be a teaching blog. Rather, each post will be a critique of a recent technical paper, blog post or presentation. I will mostly be reviewing research papers because I like to read them and think about the solutions they propose, even if some don't end up not being directly relevant to my work. 

As you'll see in my paper reviews, the recent publications on data management in the cloud is mixed. At times, the research hits the mark, offering novel algorithms and advancing the state-of-the-art. But there are also times when there is a disconnect between the solutions being offered by the research community and the ones that I think would generate more practical applications.
