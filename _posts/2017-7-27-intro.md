title: Introducing this blog
---

I've decided to start a blog to share my thoughts on modern data systems.

In the past decade, we've seen an explosion of data systems, many of them open-source. Some are even native to the cloud and also referred to as a "managed service" because they provide extra management, reliability, and scalability features. Notable examples include Amazon's Aurora, Google's Dataflow, and Microsoft's DocumentDB. I'm going to explore these and other data systems that are native to the cloud by reviewing some recent research papers on this subject area. 

My reviews will be based on my experience as a Solution Architect as well as my previous life as a Database Administrator. Each review will follow a standard format that I used as a grad student a long time ago: **1) biggest contribution;** **2) biggest mistake;** **3) biggest question**. This format may seem a bit rigid, but I think it helps to focus the discussion and keep each review down to a few paragraphs. 

My hope is that some of the reviews will be useful to those who are looking to go beyond the official how-to documentation for the products in question. My intent is to dig into the underlying systems that host these services and discuss some of the design choices and trade-offs.
