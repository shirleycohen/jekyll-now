title: Introducing this blog
---

I've decided to start a blog to share my thoughts on cloud data services. 

<!--more-->

What do I mean by "cloud data services"? I'm referring to data services that are specifically designed to run in the cloud. These services are sometimes derived from an open-source project or have led to the creation of an open-source project. Some notable examples include Amazon Aurora, Cloud Spanner, and Cosmos DB. I'm going to explore these and other cloud data services by reviewing some recent papers, blog posts, and presentations. 

My reviews will be based on my experience as a Solution Architect as well as my previous life as a Database Administrator. Each review will follow a standard format that I used as a grad student a long time ago: **1) biggest contribution;** **2) biggest mistake;** **3) biggest question**.
