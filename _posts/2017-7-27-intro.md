title: Introducing this blog
---

I've decided to start a blog to share my thoughts on cloud data services. 

<!--more-->

Several interesting data services have emerged recently that are native to the cloud. Some notable examples are AWS' Aurora, GCP's Spanner, and Azure's Cosmos DB. I'm going to explore these and other cloud data services by reviewing relevant papers, blog posts, and presentations. 

My reviews will be based on my experience as a Solution Architect as well as my previous life as a Database Administrator. Each review will follow a standard format that I used as a grad student a long time ago: **1) biggest contribution;** **2) biggest mistake;** **3) biggest question**.
