title: Introducing this blog
---

Well, I've decided to start blogging about data management in the cloud. 

Gives me a good excuse to get back into writing more regularly and also lets me write about an area that I've been deeply involved in recently. 

For those who don't know me, I'm a database practitioner. I've been working with databases for almost 2 decades, starting as a database engineer evolving to database administration and more recently database architecture. I work at Rackspace where I get to architect database solutions for customers who are moving to the cloud. I also get to <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/index.html">teach</a> a semester-long database class at UT Austin. 

I want this blog to cover a wide variety of data management topics, e.g. big data, auto-scaling, and schema evolution, all in the context of the cloud. But I don't want this to be a teaching blog. Rather, each post will be a critique of a recent paper, blog post or technical presentation. I will mostly be reviewing research papers because I like to read them and think about the ideas they contain, even if those end up not being directly relevant to my work. 

As you'll see in my paper reviews, the recent research on data management in the cloud is mixed. At times, it really seems to hit the mark, offering novel directions and advancing the state-of-the-art. But there are also times when I think there is a disconnect between the problems being investigated by the research community and the ones that I would consider important and impactful to customers.
