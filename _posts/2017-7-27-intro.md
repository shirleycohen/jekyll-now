title: Introducing this blog
---

I've decided to start a blog for sharing my thoughts on cloud data services. 

I'm going to be reviewing recent papers, presentations, and blog posts on this topic and also critiquing them. My critiques will be based on my experience as a Solution Architect as well as my previous life as a Database Administrator. Each critique will follow a standard format that I used a long time ago as a grad student: **1) biggest contribution;** **2) biggest mistake;** **3) biggest question**. 

Please note: this is my personal blog and does not reflect the views of Rackspace or its management in any way.
