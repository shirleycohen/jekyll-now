title: Introducing this blog
---

So, I've decided to start my own blog about data management in the cloud. 

Gives me a good excuse to get back into writing more regularly and also lets me write about an area that I've been deeply involved with. This blog is going to be about my views and opinions on data management in the cloud. I've been a database practitioner for almost 2 decades and for the last few years, I have had the good fortune of architecting database solutions for customers who are moving to the cloud. I'm a Database Architect at Rackspace and I also <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/index.html">teach</a> databases at UT Austin as an Adjunct Professor. You can read more about my background <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirleycohen/">here</a>. 

This blog is going to cover such diverse topics as Big Data, auto-scaling, and schema evolution all in the context of data management in the cloud. However, it's not going to be a teaching blog. Rather, each post is going to be critique of a recent research paper, blog post or technical presentation. I like reading academic papers and thinking about whether the published ideas can be applied to the use cases that I come across in my work as an architect. In fact, one of my goals with this blog is to point out where I think the research community hits the mark in terms of addressing real-world problems as well as where I see a disconnect between the research produced by the community and the practical issues faced by my customers.
