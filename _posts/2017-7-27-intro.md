title: Introducing this blog
---

I've decided to start a blog to share my thoughts and opinions on cloud data services.

But what exactly do I mean by "cloud data services"? I'm referring to services that run in the cloud and are designed for storing, processing, and analyzing data in the cloud. These services are also referred to as "managed" services because in addition to their core capabilities, they also have capabilities around management, availability, and redundancy. Interestingly, many of these services are also derived from an open-source project or have directly inspired an open-source project. Some notable examples include Amazon's Aurora, Google's Dataflow, and Microsoft's DocumentDB. I'm going to explore these and other cloud data services by reviewing recent papers, blog posts, and presentations on this subject area. 

My reviews will be based on my experience as a Solution Architect as well as my previous life as a Database Administrator. Each review will follow a standard format that I used as a grad student a long time ago: **1) biggest contribution;** **2) biggest mistake;** **3) biggest question**. This format may seem a bit rigid, but I think it helps to focus the discussion and keep each one to a few paragraphs in the length. 

My hope is that these reviews will be useful to those who are looking to go beyond the how-to documentation for these various services and want to dig deeper to understand some of the design choices and trade-offs.
