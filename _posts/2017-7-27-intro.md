title: Introducing this blog
---

Well, I've decided to start blogging about data management solutions in the cloud. 

Gives me a good excuse to get back into writing more regularly and also lets me write about an area that I've been deeply involved with. 

For those who don't know me, I've been a database practitioner for almost 2 decades. For the last few years, I have had the opportunity to architect numerous data management solutions for customers moving or expanding to the cloud. I work at Rackspace where I'm a Database Architect and also <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/index.html">teach</a> databases at UT Austin as an Adjunct Professor. You can read more about my background <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirleycohen/">here</a>. 

This blog is going to cover such diverse topics as big data, auto-scaling, and schema evolution all in the context of data management solutions in the cloud. However, it's not going to be a teaching blog. Rather, each post is going to be a critique of a recent paper, blog post or technical presentation. I often read academic papers to see if any ideas can be applied to the use cases that I come across in my work as an architect. 

As you'll see in my paper reviews, I find that the research is inconsistent. At times, it really hits the mark in terms of offering novel directions to practical problems. But there are also times where I see a great disconnect between the problems that the research community is solving for and the ones that I personally encounter when working with customers.
