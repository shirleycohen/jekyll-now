title: Introducing this blog
---

Decided to start a blog about data management. 

I'm not a writer, I'm actually a database person. I've been working with databases for almost 2 decades in industry and academia. I work at <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> as a database architect and at <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a> as an adjunct professor where I teach a <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/cs327e.html">database class</a>. Needless to say, I have a lot of opinions on data management and how it should be done... However, I also like reading research papers and thinking about how ideas from those papers are relevant or could be relevant to the use cases that I come across in my work. In fact, one of my goals with this blog is to talk about the disconnect that I sometimes see between academic research on data management and the more practical concerns that many customers face in this age of big data and cloud computing.
