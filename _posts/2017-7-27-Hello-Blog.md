title: Introducing this blog
---

So, I've decided to start a blog about data management. 

Gives me a good excuse to get back into writing more regularly and also lets me write about an area I care deeply about. This blog is going to be about my views and opinions on data management. I've been a database person for nearly 2 decades and have worked in industry and academia. I'm a Database Architect at <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> and also an Adjunct Professor at <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a> where I teach a <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/cs327e.html">database class</a> in the Fall and Spring semesters. You can read more about background here. 

This blog is going to cover topics such as Big Data and cloud computing. However, it's not going to be a teaching blog. Rather, each post is going to be a review of an interesting research paper, technical report or presentation and I will share my personal views on the subject as well. I like reading research papers and thinking about how innovative ideas can be applied to the use cases that I come across in my work as an architect. In fact, one of my goals with this blog is to point out where I think the research hits the mark in terms of solving real-work problems as well as when I see a disconnect between the research and the practical concerns that my customers face.
