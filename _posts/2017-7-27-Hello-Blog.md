title: Introducing this blog
---

Decided to start a blog about data management. 

I'm not a writer, I'm actually a database person. I've been working with databases for almost 2 decades in industry and academia. I work at Rackspace as a database architect and am also a part-time adjunct professor at UT Austin where I teach a database class. Needless to say, I have a lot of opinions on data management and how it should be done. However, I also like reading research papers and thinking about how ideas from those papers are relevant or could be relevant to the use cases that I come across in my work. In fact, one of my goals with this blog is to talk about the disconnect that I sometimes see between academic research on data management and the more practical concerns that many customers face in this age of big data and cloud computing.
