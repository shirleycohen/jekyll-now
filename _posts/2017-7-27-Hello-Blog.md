title: Introducing this blog
---

So, I've decided to start a blog about data management. 

Gives me a good excuse to get back into writing more regularly and also lets me write about an area I care deeply about. This blog is going to be about my views and opinions on data management. I've been a database person for nearly 2 decades and have had the fortune to work in industry and academia. I'm currently at Rackspace where I work as a Database Architect and also teach <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/cs327e.html">databases</a> at UT Austin where I'm an Adjunct Professor. You can read more about my background <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirleycohen/">here</a>. 

This blog is going to cover topics such as Big Data and cloud computing within the context of data management. However, it's not going to be a teaching blog. Rather, each post is going to be an opinionated review of a research paper, technical report or presentation. I like reading research papers and thinking about how innovative ideas can be applied to the use cases that I come across in my work as an architect. In fact, one of my goals with this blog is to point out where I think the research hits the mark in terms of solving real-work problems as well as where I see a disconnect between the research and the practical concerns that my customers face.
