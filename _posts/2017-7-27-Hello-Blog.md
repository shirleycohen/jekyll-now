title: Introducing this blog
---

So, I decided to start a blog about data management. 

I'm not a writer, I'm actually a database person. I've been working with databases for almost 2 decades, both in industry and academia. I work at <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> as a database architect and also at <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a> as an adjunct professor where I teach a <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/cs327e.html">database class</a> in the Fall and Spring semesters. Needless to say, I have a lot of opinions on data management and how it should be done... I also like reading research papers and thinking about how the ideas from those papers can be applied to the use cases that I come across in my work as an architect. In fact, one of my goals with this blog is to review some recent publications from the database research community and point out where I think the research hits the mark in terms of solving real-work problems as well as when there is a disconnect between the research and the more practical concerns that my customers face. Stay tuned.
