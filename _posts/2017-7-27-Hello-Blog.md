title: Introducing this blog
---

So, I've decided to start a blog about data management in the cloud. 

Gives me a good excuse to get back into writing more regularly and also lets me write about an area that I care deeply about. This blog is going to be about my views and opinions on data management in the cloud. I've been a database practitioner for almost 2 decades now and have had the good fortune of working in industry and academia. I'm currently a Database Architect at Rackspace where I've been employed for the last 4 years and I also teach <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scohen/cs327e.html">databases</a> at UT Austin where I'm an Adjunct Professor. You can read more about my background <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirleycohen/">here</a>. 

This blog is going to cover such topics as Big Data, auto-scaling, and schema evolution all in the context of the cloud. However, it's not going to be a teaching blog. Rather, each post is going to be critique of a recently published research paper, technical report or presentation. I like reading research papers and thinking about how new ideas can be applied to the use cases that I come across in my work as an architect. In fact, one of my goals with this blog is to point out where I think the research hits the mark in terms of addressing real-world data management problems as well as where I see a disconnect between the research ideas being proposed and the practical concerns faced by some of my customers.
